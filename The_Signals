#### The Buying Signals

There is a joke amongst sales people that a "No Solicitation" sign is a sign that just says, "I can't say no."

I can tell you that there was only one time in my life that a "No Solicitation" sign made me _hesitate_. It was the same size of the logo, about 2' x 3'. It still didn't stop me from going in, and it shouldn't stop you either. Sure that hesitation was worthy. Behind that door was a 6 foot 7 inch beast, bald headed, shredded. I still asked who the person was in charge of marketing. He got up, and escorted me out the door. Pointed to that sign, and asked if I could read. I politely responded, sorry I must of missed that. I went on my way to the next business. That was one of the worst cases I have ever experienced. I'm still here, and at least now I have something to joke about.

I can't tell you how many of those "No Solicitation" signs I have ignored, and how many of those I have converted, but I know it's a positive number. 

While a "No Solicitation" sign is not a buying signal, businesses have plenty of them around. Anything from the decals they put on their door, to their activity on social media, to an article you can find online.

Simply put, a buying signal is anything you can identify as a potential that the business could be interested in your products. The key is though to ensure that you will identify each prospect with a buying signal. Where did you find them? What made you call them?

Why the extra work? 

These signals are what you do to adjust your pitch to effectively present your opener. I’ll go more into this later, but let’s compare quickly these two openings lines for someone in the social media business. “Hi, is the owner there?” vs. “Hi (Jane), I was hoping you could help me out. I noticed your FB page hasn’t had any activity in the past month. We have helped (restaurants) grow their online fan base by 35%, and increasing their ROI on social media by 105%. Could you tell me who I could speak to about this?”

Over a period of time, it could even be hours or as long as months, you will slowly start to discover a trend. Certain buying signals convert stronger than others. I would identify these buying signals as strong, medium, weak. 

Here are some of my buying signals that I used to target potential prospects when I was selling lead generation:

HomeAdvisor - Strong
Groupon - Medium
ThumbTack - Weak

How did I come to that conclusion? It took about 15 calls to each. HomeAdvisor leads were easily converting, more open to chatting. The pitch was focused on our benefits vs. there's. It was proving that there is a better way to advertise than HomeAdvisor.

ThumbTack leads were an interesting bunch. I swore before I started calling down the list, that this too would be a high converting group. Yet, from my chats with them my conversion was about 5%. These people were so turned off lead generation, they wanted nothing more of it.

Groupon. I threw group in as a potential "buying signal". Certain leads could have been grabbed from this source. The conversion was much tougher. They have grown accustomed to just having more "pour" :rolleyes: into their account. I thought I could present logic & ROI as facts to convert them into lead generation system. It sort of worked. The business that would listen, converted. Those that didn't want to see the numbers behind a Groupon, didn't. It was why I classified them as weak.

As I started to talk about above, these buying signals are what tailor your presentations into things that are much more powerful. I'll let you in quickly on a little dirty secret of mine. My pitch when I was selling daily deals, to what were "hot hot" buying signals was this:

"Hey Mr. Prospect, I saw your _amazing_ promotion on [daily deal site], how did that work out for you?"

That was my whole pitch to catch the buyers ears. That one open ended question reveal so much about the prospect that my closing ratio on cold-calls that I reached the decision maker was something around 35%. Over time, that buying signal was producing so many leads, qualified leads, and such knowledge leads, that all I had to do was uncover the pain of that caused them to do a daily deal, and re-sell it.
