### Chapter 1

#### Background

My father was always a sales person and an entrepreneur. From his stories, I think my sales career started when I was just 10 years old. We were at a auto-show for one of his businesses. He had to run off to meet with a client and I was left to man his booth for a short half hour. When he came back, I sold a $590 product. He was befuddled. Not only did I close a sale for a $590 product, at the age of 10, I also got the guy to give me a $10 tip for it. Plus, I got a $50 commission from my father :-)

Fast forward to my teenager years and my father was in the swimming pool industry. Being somewhat of a geek, I was helping him out with permit drawings, pool drawings, and things of the computer nature. One afternoon, when I was 17, I got thrown in to the true gauntlet of sales. He best salesperson from his previous company just moved out to help out with sales. We were short-staffed for the amount of leads were getting. My father his best sales person who had no knowledge about pools out with me to new lead. 

We ended up closing that sale, and over the next 6 months a lot more of them. Slowly though, we both got tired of splitting commission. So sometime right before I turned 18, we split ways and went out on our own -- and there was still plenty of leads for the us splitting up.

I landed my first deal, a $25,000 pool, before I could even legally signed the contract between the company and the client. And over the next several years, I set unprecedented records. At 20, I did over $1,000,000 in pool sales in just 3 months, when the companyâ€™s previous annual revenue was just $853,000. 

I finally got a breakthrough into Business-to-Business (B2B) sales in July of 2010. With a company that was entering the space of daily deals. Nobody really knew what daily deals were back then though. We had to pitch this abstract concept to business owners on how this new form advertising shifted the burden of paying. 

Over the next 2 years I spent with the company, I put up numbers that were unfathomable. In the group that I got hired, I put up 2 sales before the second person closed their first deal. In their first sales competition, I doubled the volume of the second place finisher. At one point, that had me finally all over the country to help teams out. In 2012, I got moved into a Sales Leadership role, and built a brand new team from scratch. In just 3 months, our team was already producing at one of the top levels of the company.
