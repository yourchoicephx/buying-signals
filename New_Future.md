The Beginning of Your Future.

Sales doesn’t begin the moment you pick the phone to make a call. It doesn’t even start the moment you get to the office, or when you start your day. It starts the moment you wake up. Your own belief, your own attitude, and your appearance is where everything begins.

I want you think about something for a little bit; “Your prospects can not have more enthusiasm than you.”

Let that really sink before you go any further. Think about all the sales calls you had and all the sales calls you may have made up until now. When you were being pitched to, did you ever honestly show more passion or enthusiasm than the person pitching? What about your prospects? Did they ever do that?

I strongly doubt it. It may have happened in a blue moon, because you already knew what you wanted and that person was just merely taking your order. But that wasn’t sales. 

The attitude you have, the way you feel about yourself, the self-confidence you display are all the beginning ingredients of sales. A prospect can sense that you have self-doubt. The problem is they don’t know where it is coming from, nor do they care. Even if you have a product that you believe will do wonders for them, but you have self-doubt about your own sales ability, you will suffer in sales. The prospect will feel that. Except, they will think it has to do with the product. 

So there I was in San Francisco, on a trip that I got invited on as one of the leading sales people. Here I was on the third day of the trip, falling behind the pack. It was approaching 5pm, and I still haven't had a sale in the day. I was feeling down at that moment. All day, we have been getting email updates that somebody else closed a sale. Every step I took felt wrong, no business owner was there.

I took 10 minutes to recollect myself. Think about my pitch. Was I doing something wrong? What was going on? Here is one of the leading sales people in the country, and I'm not even close to being on the leaderboard. I got all those thoughts out of my head though. I had to.

I walked back out onto the street, and kept pushing through. The next door that I walked through, I got the merchant to agree to meet me at 8:30pm, since he was slammed right now. Wow. Alright, I'll meet him. I _NEED_ that sale. But hey, at least something is clicky.

And that was all that I need to jump start my self confidence. A couple businesses later of prospecting, and I'm sitting down with another owner. Contract Signed! It's 6:45pm though. I still got time till the appointment at 8:30pm. So off I went to do more cold-calling prospecting. Bam! Another Sale from another merchant! By the time that 8:30pm came around, I was on such a cloud nine, there was nothing that was stopping me from closing that final appointment.

I tried things that I probably wouldn't have normally tried. He pushed back, and he was relcutant. Finally, I said something to the tune of "Look, I know you are really thinking about this. I am out here from Phoenix, on this 3 day sales blitz. My team is just 1 deal short of hitting a huge bonus. Tonight's our last night. Could you just give this a shot to help out the whole?"

Sure enough, contract signed. The funny thing about that whole day was, all those emails I was getting weren't really that truthful. You see, the day before we got about 6 emails about contracts closed, and that day we finished with 15. So the next day, when we got 8 emails, I thought there was going to be a stellar day for the team. In fact, those 8 emails, were the only 8 we got. We had 16 sales people out in the field that day. 

That little boost of confidence was all that I needed in myself was what put on top of that leaderboard again.

As your first step to begin the future of your journey, I want you to create a routine. Something that you know will you put in that spot of happiness, self belief, and give you the confidence you need to push forward. For me, it was always thinking about the last great achievement I did and paired with a pump me up song.
