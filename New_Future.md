The Beginning of Your Future.

Sales doesn’t begin the moment you pick the phone to make a call. It doesn’t even start the moment you get to the office, or when you start your day. It starts the moment you wake up. Your own belief, your own attitude, and your appearance is where everything begins.

I want you think about something for a little bit; “Your prospects can not have more enthusiasm than you.”

Let that really sink before you go any further. Think about all the sales calls you had and all the sales calls you may have made up until now. When you were being pitched to, did you ever honestly show more passion or enthusiasm than the person pitching? What about your prospects? Did they ever do that?

I strongly doubt it. It may have happened in a blue moon, because you already knew what you wanted and that person was just merely taking your order. But that wasn’t sales. 

The attitude you have, the way you feel about yourself, the self-confidence you display are all the beginning ingredients of sales. A prospect can sense that you have self-doubt. The problem is they don’t know where it is coming from, nor do they care. Even if you have a product that you believe will do wonders for them, but you have self-doubt about your own sales ability, you will suffer in sales. The prospect will feel that. Except, they will think it has to do with the product. 

As your first step to begin the future of your journey, I want you to create a routine. Something that you know will you put in that spot of happiness, self belief, and give you the confidence you need to push forward. For me, it was always thinking about the last great achievement I did and paired with a pump me up song.
