### The Hard Road Ahead.

Sales is an emotional roller coaster, and you need to be able to shrug off feelings with ease. There will be days you feel like you are on top of the world with the way you are closing days. And then will come the days of sorrow. Every prospect will reject you, you won’t make any head way on your pipeline, your boss may even yell at you (or if you are going at it solo, your significant other). 

It’s okay though, remember that this is a roller coaster you are signing up for. There will come times that you will need to recollect yourself, give yourself a pat on the back and re-energize yourself. All sales people have had to do it at one point or another. The difference is, those that can do it successfully are the ones that can have continued success. 

As mentioned earlier, your emotions play a large role in how well you will be able to sell. You can’t let anything affect you. A prospect doesn’t care about your personal life, your problems. So don’t bring it in either consciously or subconsciously. We won’t go further into self attitude as you can grab thousands of other books that go into way more depth than I will ever be able to. 

Remember, you control the sale, you control everything. Don’t make it harder on yourself.
